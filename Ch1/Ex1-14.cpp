/*  Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those
using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?*/

/*
 * 	Simply put the for loop can be quicker and more accurate and less likely to break
 * as it places an emphasis on having all the conditions and changes in one place.
 *
 * However while loops tend to be more readable, further they look cleaner.
 * From a grammatical point of view, for loops should be used when you know the amount
 * of loops you need (but this isn't hard and fast) whereas a while loop should be used
 * if you don't.
 *
 * I find for loops to more more logical and easier to maintain, but that might not be
 * the same for everyone. Especially if comments and variables are not concise and well defined.
