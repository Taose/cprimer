/* Exercise 2.11: Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a
definition:
 *
 * a) extern int ix = 1024;
 * 		//While it is supposed to be a declaration, it is being redefined. Thus a definition
 * b) int iy;
 * 		//Strictly speaking a declaration.
 *
 * c) extern int iz;
 * 		//A declaration.
