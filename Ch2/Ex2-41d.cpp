/* Exercise 2.41: Use your Sales_data class to rewrite the exercises in ยง1.51, 1.5.2, 1.6.
 For now define the Sales_data class in the same file as the main function
 *
 * Exercise 1.25 (page 53)
 *
 * Exercise 1.25 is quite specific, it is impossible to comply with the idea of the exercise
 * and with Exercise 2.41 as the book store program will not compile with Transaction due to
 * different syntax.... and Sales_data.h is vastly more complex.
 *
 * However...
 *
 * #ifndef TRANSACTION_H
 * #def TRANSACTION_H
 *
 * struct Transaction
 * {
 * 		std::string isbn{""};
 * 		unsigned int qty{0};
 * 		double price{0.0};
 * }
 * #endif
 *
 *
 * May be what the question is asking for.
 *
 * Further
 *
 * #include "ex2-41d-Transaction.h"
 *
 * May be required.
