/*Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.
 *
 * Pointers are objects that can point to many different objects.
 * References are not objects, but aliases for other values.
 *
 * Other than that they both create a "temporary" instance, but both
 * have access to the original variables.
