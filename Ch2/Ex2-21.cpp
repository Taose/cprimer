/*Exercise 2.21: Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether
any are illegal and, if so, why.
 *
 * int i = 0;
 * a) double* dp = &i; //In theory valid but throws up errors due to potential loss of data.
 * b) int *ip = i; //Not valid, the value of i is not an address.
 * c) int *p = &i; //Fine. *p is 0.
